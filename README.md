Given a dataset of various patient measurements, the goal is to determine whether a patient has crucial liver disorders (class 2) or non-crucial liver disorders (class 1). Due to class imbalance, after cleaning, preprocessing, and eliminating outliers, we apply the 
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the imbalance. Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to extract features with low or no contribution to the final outcome of predicting liver disorders.
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and eight models are tested: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Bagging, and Boosting Ensembles. These models are evaluated based on
confusion matrices, ROC curves, and various metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. The goal is to identify the model that best fits this project.
